🏙️ Airbnb Listings EDA Project: New York 2024










📘 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings in New York City (2024) to uncover rental trends, pricing patterns, and host behaviors.
It uses Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for cleaning, visualization, and insight generation.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze room types, prices, and availability across different neighborhoods.

Study host behavior and listing patterns.

Detect and handle outliers in pricing data.

Provide data-driven recommendations for guests and hosts.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains ~20,000 Airbnb listings with the following key features:

id: Unique identifier

name: Listing title

host_name: Host’s name

neighborhood_group: Borough of the listing

latitude, longitude: Location coordinates

price: Nightly rate

room_type: Accommodation type

reviews_per_month: Average monthly reviews

availability_365: Available days per year

🧹 Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in price, beds, and neighborhood.

Converted date fields (e.g., last_review) to datetime format.

Filtered listings with price > $1,000 to reduce skewed visuals.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Room Type Distribution

Visualized using bar charts; Entire home/apt was the most common.

2. Price by Neighborhood

Manhattan showed the highest average prices.

Brooklyn followed as a popular mid-range area.

3. Availability Trends

Used heatmaps to correlate price, availability, and reviews.

4. Outlier Detection

Boxplots and histograms were used to detect extreme price points.

5. Host Insights

Analyzed hosts with multiple listings — many are professional hosts managing several properties.

📉 Visualizations Used

Histograms & Boxplots → Price distribution and outliers

Barplots → Room types and borough comparisons

Heatmaps → Correlation among numerical variables

Pairplots → Relationship between reviews, price, and availability

🔍 Key Findings

Manhattan listings are the most expensive.

Entire homes/apartments dominate but are costlier than private rooms.

Outliers exist above $10,000/night and should be filtered.

High availability often links to lower prices.

Some hosts manage multiple listings, showing professional behavior.
